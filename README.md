A ~3 years old project. Needs to get revised.
Abstract:
Our aim was to create a user-friendly single page website that assists college students with limited knowledge and information on everyday technology to make the best decisions about the products that suit their needs. We acknowledge that searching for the right laptop can be overwhelming, and our website seeks to simplify this process by presenting only the most relevant information. Our website prioritizes ease of use, functionality, and visual appeal to provide the best possible user experience. Our website is designed to be both simplistic and functional, promising a hassle-free experience for consumers.

1 Project Description:
The website assists users to shop for a suitable laptop. We kept the website manageable with information relevant to college students such as the processor, RAM, resolution, size, operating system, storage, and ofcourse price. Each product will contain these information, which are stored in a Mongo database. Products are not be based on any specific brand; we included a wide variety of products that covered every basis and liking of consumers.
By clicking on the “Add to cart” button users will be able to have several items in their cart. They will be able to delete some of the products from their cart. Then, they will be able to see the total price and checkout.

The website also includes a search bar that allows users to look for a specific item. When they type some letters, any items that their names match, the letters will appear. And as the user finish typing the word, fewer items will appear until they find that specific item that they are looking for.


Also, you could see on the navigation bar includes Add Item, Update Item buttons, which allow the users to add any items they would like along with its specification to the website, or they could delete or update items by clicking on update item. Then, ourwebsite inludes an About us page, which introduces the developers of the webpage. Please note that this is a single-page website. Therefore, all of the above pages are on one webpage.


When finishing shopping, costumers will be directed to the Checkout page, where they will enter their card information and address. They can also find their state from the dropdown that we included on the checkout page. Lastly, their information need to be in the correct format, otherwise there will be an error and they would not be able to place their order. If everything is correct, their order will be placed.
For the database, we used MongoDB to store all of our data in it. The data includes the specification of the laptops, and their pictures.
